# Clean PHP Documentation Repository

In this repository, we will provide examples of good practices in PHP based on SOLID, Clean Code principles and some other resources that imply writing a better code in a daily basis. These examples will include information on naming conventions, functions, objects and data structures, comments, and formatting.

By following these examples, you can write clean and maintainable PHP code that is easy to understand and modify.
