# Clean PHP Documentation Repository

## Introduction

Welcome to the Clean PHP Documentation Repository, where we strive to provide comprehensive and up-to-date information on writing clean, maintainable, and scalable PHP code. Here, you will find information on SOLID patterns and Clean Code principles, as well as examples of good practices in PHP.

Our goal is to provide you with the tools and knowledge you need to write code that is easy to understand, modify, and test, so that you can build high-quality software that is reliable, efficient, and scalable.

## SOLID Patterns and Clean Code

[SOLID](scaffold/docs/SOLID/SOLID_PRINCIPLES.md) is a set of five design principles for writing maintainable and scalable software. These principles promote code that is easy to understand, modify, and test, and help to prevent code from becoming complex and difficult to maintain.

[Clean Code](scaffold/docs/CleanCode/CLEAN_CODE.md), on the other hand, is a set of guidelines for writing code that is easy to read, understand, and modify. Clean Code encourages the use of simple, clear, and concise code that follows established conventions and principles, and helps to avoid code that is confusing, inconsistent, or difficult to maintain.

## PHP Examples
In this repository, we will provide examples of good practices in PHP based on [SOLID](scaffold/docs/SOLID/SOLID_PRINCIPLES.md), [Clean Code](scaffold/docs/CleanCode/CLEAN_CODE.md) principles and some other [resources](scaffold/docs/Extra/RIGOR_TALKS.md) that imply writing a better code in a daily basis. These examples will include information on naming conventions, functions, objects and data structures, comments, and formatting. 

By following these examples, you can write clean and maintainable PHP code that is easy to understand and modify.
